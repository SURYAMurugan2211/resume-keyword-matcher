Phase A — prototype / wireframe

Create a dark-mode single-page wireframe for a Resume Keyword Matcher. Include: header with logo, two large textareas (Job Description and Resume), an Analyze button, a Clear button, and three result panels: Matched Keywords, Missing Keywords, and Resume with highlights. Keep layout responsive. Provide a rough HTML skeleton only.

Convert the wireframe into responsive HTML structure with semantic elements and placeholder classes (no CSS). Output a complete index.html file content.

Phase B — styling
3. Generate a Dark Mode Premium CSS for the Resume Keyword Matcher. Use modern fonts, gradients for accent, rounded cards, and accessible contrast. The layout must match the wireframe and be responsive. Provide the full CSS content.

Phase C — JavaScript
4. Write client-side JavaScript that tokenizes job description and resume, removes stopwords, finds matched keywords using substring matching (case-insensitive), computes a match score, highlights matched keywords in the resume display, and updates the DOM. No external libraries. Provide script.js ready to paste.

Add user-friendly messages and simple validation: if inputs are empty, show alert; provide Clear functionality. Also ensure score updates and accessibility attributes.

Phase D — polish & performance
6. Review the HTML/CSS/JS and suggest three micro-optimizations to reduce bundle size and improve accessibility. Output code patches or small snippet edits.

Create text content for README.md describing installation, usage, Kiro prompts used, and final deployment steps for GitHub Pages.

Phase E — blog content
8. Draft an AWS Builder Center style blog post titled "Building an AI Resume Keyword Matcher with Kiro — Dark Mode Premium" that covers problem statement, architecture, Kiro prompts (with screenshots), code snippets, how Kiro accelerated development, and deployment steps. Keep it technical but readable. Provide final markdown content.

Phase F — final QA
